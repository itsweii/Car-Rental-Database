Properties for rent  
The data stored on property for rent includes property number, address (street, city, and postcode), type, number of rooms, monthly rent, and the details of the property owner. The monthly rent for a property is reviewed annually. Most of the properties rented out by DreamHome are apartments (or flats). The management of a property is assigned to a member of staff whenever it is rented out or ready to be rented out. A member of staff may manage a maximum of 100 properties for rent at any one time.  
Property owners  
There are two main types of property owner: private owners and business owners. The data stored on private owners includes owner number, name (first and last name), address, telephone number, email, and password. The data stored on business owners includes owner number, name of business, business type, address, telephone number, email, password, and contact name.  
Clients  
When a prospective client registers with DreamHome, the data stored includes the client number, name (first and last name), telephone number, email, and some data on the desired property, including the preferred type of accommodation and the maximum rent that the client is prepared to pay. Also stored is the name of the member of staff who registered the new client.  
Property viewings  
Clients may request to view property. The data stored includes client number, name and telephone number, property number and address, date the client viewed the property, and any comments made by the client regarding the suitability of the property. A client may view the same property only once on a given date.  
Leases  
Once a client finds a suitable property, a lease is drawn up. The information on the lease includes lease number, client number and name, property number, address, type and number of rooms, monthly rent, method of payment, deposit (calculated as twice the monthly rent), whether the deposit is paid, the start and end dates of the rental period, and the duration of the lease. The lease number is unique across all DreamHome branches. A client may hold a lease associated with a given property from a minimum of three months to a maximum of 1 year.
